Statistics
----------

Events
~~~~~~

The usage statistics of the Zenodo records are generated from two different types of events:

* ``record-view``: this event is related to the view of a record and it's bounded to the ``record_viewed`` signal, which is
  emitted when one the following endpoints is accessed:

    * ``/record/<recid>``
    * ``/record/<recid>/export/<format>``

* ``file-download``: this event is related to the download a file of a record and it's is bounded to
  the  ``file_downloaded`` signal, which is emitted when one the following endpoints is accessed:

    * ``/record/<recid>/files/<filename>``
    * ``/api/record/<recid>/files/<filename>``

Every time a user views a record or downloads a file, the corresponding signal is emitted and the corresponding
event is created. In case an event fails to be emitted due to an exception raised in an event builder or to a failure
in sending the message to RabbitMQ, the request is not affected and a warning message is logged.

At the creation time each event keeps track of the following fields:

* record_id
* recid
* conceptrecid
* doi
* conceptdoi
* access_right
* resource_type
* communities
* owners
* timestamp
* referrer

We also capture the following user related fields for a limited period of time, i.e. until the event is processed
and the data are anonymized:

* ip_address
* user_agent
* user_id
* session_id

There are also some fields which are event specific.
For the ``file-download`` event we track:

* bucket_id
* file_id
* file_key
* size

While for the ``record-view`` event we track:

* pid_type
* pid_value

After an event is created, it is sent to a dedicated RabbitMQ queue. Each type of event has its own queue, so
different types of events can be processed separately.
The events which are in the queue are then consumed and processed by a Celery task. In this step the
flags ``is_machine`` and ``is_robot`` are added, the user is anonymized and the double-clicks are deleted. During the data
anonymization process the user related fields are deleted and replaced by the ``visitor_id`` and the ``unique_session_id``.
In case an event fails to be processed (e.g. malformed IP address), the event is skipped/lost and a warning message
is logged.
After the processing, the robot events are discarded for space saving, since they are not relevant for the statistics.
All of the other processed events are saved in Elasticsearch.

Aggregations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the events generated by the record views or downloads are aggregated in several ways to produce daily statistics.
Here you can find the list of the different types of aggregations used by Zenodo:

* ``record-view-agg``: this aggregation is applied to the ``record-view`` events and it calculates the daily views and
  unique views of a specific version of a record;
* ``record-view-all-versions-agg``: this aggregation is applied to the ``record-view`` events and it calculates the daily
  views and unique views of all versions of a record;
* ``record-download-agg``: this aggregation is applied to the ``file-download`` events and it calculates the daily downloads
  and unique downloads of a specific version of a record;
* ``record-download-all-versions-agg``: this aggregation is applied to the ``file-download`` events and it calculates
  the daily downloads and unique downloads of all versions of a record.

Both the ``record-view-agg`` and the ``record-view-all-versions-agg`` are applied to the same ``record-view`` events
and the documents they produce are stored within the same index. The difference between these two aggregations is
that, while the first one aggregates the events by the ``recid``, the second one does the aggregation by the
``conceptrecid``. This leads to two different results: in the first case we have the statistics for a single version of
a record, while in the second case we have the statistics for all the versions of a record.

For example, let's say that we have the following ``record-view`` events:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "timestamp": "2018-07-20 17:30:00",
        "recid": "123456",
        "conceptrecid": "78910",
        ...
    }

    {
        "timestamp": "2018-07-20 17:45:00",
        "recid": "123456",
        "conceptrecid": "78910",
        ...
    }

    {
        "timestamp": "2018-07-20 18:20:00",
        "recid": "26245",
        "conceptrecid": "78910",
        ...
    }


The result of the ``record-view-agg`` will be two documents, one for each version of the record:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "timestamp": "2018-07-23 10:30:00",
        "count": 2,
        "unique_count": 1,
        "recid": "123456",
        "conceptrecid": "78910",
        "is_parent": False,
        ...
    }

    {
        "timestamp": "2018-07-23 10:30:00",
        "count": 1,
        "unique_count": 1,
        "recid": "26245",
        "conceptrecid": "78910",
        "is_parent": False,
        ...
    }

The result of ``record-view-all-versions-agg`` will be one document which summarize the statistics of both versions
of the record:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "timestamp": "2018-07-23 10:30:00",
        "count": 3,
        "unique_count": 2,
        "recid": "78910",
        "conceptrecid": "78910",
        "is_parent": True,
        ...
    }


The same happens for the ``record-download-agg`` and the ``record-download-all-versions-agg``, which are applied to the
``file-download`` events.

In order to count the total number of unique views (and unique downloads) of a record, it's necessary to identify each
1 hour user-session with a unique id, called ``unique_session_id``. All the views (and all the downloads) made from
the same user within the same one hour session have the same ``unique_session_id``. In this way we can easily count
the total number of unique views (or unique downloads) of a record as the cardinality of the ``unique_session_id``
present in the events related to the record.

All the new aggregations are registered via the ``register_aggregations`` method. The aggregation task runs every hour
and takes the events from Elasticsearch.
